# Medical Calendar

This is a full-stack project made with:

+ Django
+ jwt token auth
+ GraphQL
+ ReactJS
+ TypeScript

its purpose is to provide an example of a practical way of integrating all these technologies.
MediCal serves as web portal for setting and managing appointments and patients' records for a hypothetical medical clinic.
The source-code has been to use AWS RDS to store data, be served on an AWS EC2 using nginx + gunicorn, and send emails using AWS SES.
However, the setup is flexible enough to handle different configurations.

Please, notice that the source-code is provided without warranty. This is an unfinished project not meant for production.
